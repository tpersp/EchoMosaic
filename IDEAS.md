A running list of ideas and future improvements. Add new items anywhere below.

- [ ] Stream real-time update logs via Socket.IO instead of a client-side animation.
- [ ] Add a simple “Update history” view in Settings showing prior updates and commit messages.

Notes
- Use checkboxes to track status (unchecked → planned, checked → done).
- Optionally prefix entries with a date, e.g., `[2025-09-07] Idea text…`.
- Group related items under short headings if this grows large.
