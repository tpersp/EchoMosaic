# List of Ideas

A running list of ideas and future improvements. Add new items anywhere below.

- [ ] Stream real-time update logs via Socket.IO instead of a client-side animation.
- [ ] Add a simple “Update history” view in Settings showing prior updates and commit messages.
- [ ] Add a “Show only selected” count or filter in the dashboard to quickly see which streams are included.
- [ ] Provide bulk toggle actions (e.g., include/exclude all).
- [ ] Custom stream labels/names and user-selected color tags for easier dashboard navigation - This would give a custom /steam/*custom-name* and option to create custom group of streams like a "stream group" so user can choose which streams to show on a custom multi-stream, similar to the original /stream page.
- [ ] “Slideshow sync”: sync transitions across all streams (e.g., all change every 10s together), to prevent them from changing at "random interval" when having multiple streams on one screen or near eachother.
- [ ] Low-bandwidth mode: auto-reduces image resolution for remote access.
- [ ] Show a live thumbnail preview for each stream’s current content directly on the dashboard (so you can see all streams at a glance before opening them).
- [ ] Add a settings backup/export feature so custom streams/folders/tags can be quickly restored or moved to another device.


Notes
- Use checkboxes to track status (unchecked → planned, checked → done).
- Optionally prefix entries with a date, e.g., `[2025-09-07] Idea text…`.
- Group related items under short headings if this grows large.
